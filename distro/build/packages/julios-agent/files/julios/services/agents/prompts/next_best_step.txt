INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze the context and suggest exactly ONE action the user should take right now.
Consider:
- Upcoming deadlines and calendar conflicts
- Energy level (fatigue signals from sleep, recent workouts)
- Time available in next 2 hours
- Goal alignment

Prioritize high-value work when energy is high, recovery when fatigue is present.
Keep duration realistic (10-90 minutes).
